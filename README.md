## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A simple and fun challenge. The main takeaway with this one for me would be the thumbnail section for the image.
Since the one that was provided is larger than the end result's image resolution, it had to be cropped as such.
